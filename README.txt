This is part of my application to Rally Software.  This is Exercise 3 from the application exercises.  It is written in C#.

The main code files are:
RallyNumberSpiral\Program.cs and
RallyNumberSpiral\NumberSpiral.cs 

The unit tests can be found in
RallyNumberSpiral.Tests\NumberSpiralTests.cs

------------
-Exercise 3-
------------
Write some code that accepts an integer and prints the integers 
from 0 to that input integer in a spiral format.

For example, if I supplied 24 the output would be:

20 21 22 23 24
19  6  7  8  9
18  5  0  1 10
17  4  3  2 11
16 15 14 13 12


Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
